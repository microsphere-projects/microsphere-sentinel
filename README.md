Microsphere Sentinel is a multi-module Maven project that provides seamless integration between Alibaba Sentinel flow
control framework and commonly used Java technologies. The project acts as an abstraction layer that enables transparent
application of Sentinel's flow control, circuit breaking, and system protection capabilities to database operations,
caching, and other infrastructure components.

The project follows a layered approach, offering both low-level integration APIs and high-level auto-configuration for
Spring Boot applications. This design allows developers to adopt Sentinel protection incrementally, from core
infrastructure components to complete application-level integration:

- Web
    - Spring Web
        - Spring WebMVC
        - Spring WebFlux
- Database access
    - Alibaba Druid
    - Hibernate
    - MyBatis
    - P6Spy
- Redis
    - Spring Data Redis

## Modules

| **Module**                            | **Purpose**                                                            |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **microsphere-alibaba-sentinel-parent**       | Defines the parent POM with dependency management and version profiles |
| **microsphere-alibaba-sentinel-dependencies** | Centralizes dependency management for all project modules              |
| **microsphere-alibaba-sentinel-commons**      | Common featurues of Alibaba Sentinel extension                         |

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by adding the Microsphere Alibaba Sentinel BOM (Bill of Materials) to your project's
pom.xml:

```xml

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <!-- Microsphere Alibaba Sentinel Dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.microsphere-projects</groupId>
            <artifactId>microsphere-alibaba-sentinel-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${microsphere-alibaba-sentinel.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

`${microsphere-alibaba-sentinel.version}` has two branches:

| **Branches** | **Purpose**                                      | **Latest Version** |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **main**    | Compatible with Spring Cloud 2022.0.x - 2025.0.x | 0.2.0              |
| **1.x**    | Compatible with Spring Cloud Hoxton - 2021.0.x   | 0.1.0              |
